# Vercel Deployment Guide for DSecure Frontend

## 🎯 Problem Solved
This config2. **Vercel receives request** for `/services`ration fixes the "Page Not Found" (404) errors that occur when users directly access routes like `/services`, `/solutions`, `/dashboard`, etc. in a React Single Page Application.

## 🔧 Files Added/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` - Primary SPA Configuration
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Redirects all requests to `index.html` so React Router can handle routing.

### 2. `vite.config.ts` - Build Optimizations
- Added `base: './'` for relative paths
- Configured chunk splitting for better caching
- Optimized build output for production

### 3. `public/404.html` - Fallback Support
- Additional 404 handling with redirect logic
- Preserves original URL for proper routing

### 4. `public/_redirects` - Universal Support
- Netlify-style redirects (works on some platforms)
- Fallback for non-Vercel hosting

### 5. `index.html` - Client-side Redirect Handling
- Added script to handle redirects from 404 page
- Maintains proper URL state

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
cd dsecure-frontend
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? [Your account]
# - Link to existing project? N
# - Project name: dsecure-frontend
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? N
```

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Set Framework Preset to "Vite"
5. Build Command: `npm run build`
6. Output Directory: `dist`
7. Deploy

## ✅ What This Fixes

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ Direct URL access: `yourdomain.com/services` → 404 Error
- ❌ Page refresh: User on `/solutions` refreshes → 404 Error
- ❌ Bookmarked URLs: Saved `/dashboard` link → 404 Error
- ❌ Shared links: Share `/contact` → Recipients get 404

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Direct URL access: `yourdomain.com/services` → Services Page
- ✅ Page refresh: User on `/solutions` refreshes → Stays on Solutions
- ✅ Bookmarked URLs: Saved `/dashboard` link → Opens Dashboard
- ✅ Shared links: Share `/contact` → Recipients see Contact Page

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User visits `/services`**
2. **Vercel receives request** for `/products`
3. **vercel.json rewrites** request to `/index.html`
4. **React app loads** with `/index.html`
5. **React Router reads URL** (`/services`)
6. **React Router renders** ServicesPage component

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Test these URLs directly in your browser:
- `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/`
- `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/services`
- `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/solutions`
- `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/dashboard`
- `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/admin`

All should load correctly without 404 errors!
