## 🛠️ Technical Achievements

### 1. **Enhanced reCAPTCHA System** (`EnhancedRecaptcha.tsx`)
```typescript
✅ Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
✅ Automatic script loading and retry mechanisms  
✅ Proper TypeScript declarations (no conflicts)
✅ Loading states with visual indicators
✅ Widget lifecycle management with cleanup
✅ Custom hook integration (useRecaptcha)
✅ Responsive design with error recovery
```

### 2. **Unified Form Endpoint Strategy**
