# Vercel Deployment with Cloudinary Setup

## üö® Issue: Logo Not Showing on Vercel Despite Environment Variable Set

If you've added `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dhwi5wevf` to Vercel but logos still don't show, follow this comprehensive troubleshooting guide.

## ‚úÖ Recent Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ Improved CloudinaryLogo component with proper fallback support
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and debugging
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate fallback images
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging tools

## üîß Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Verify Environment Variable in Vercel
1. **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. **Confirm**:
   - Variable name: `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` (exact spelling)
   - Value: `dhwi5wevf` (exact value)
   - Environment: **Production** ‚úì
3. **After setting**: Click **Redeploy** from Deployments tab

### Step 2: Test Environment Variable Detection
Visit these debug URLs on your deployed site:

**Option A - Debug Page:**
```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/debug.html
```

**Option B - Diagnostics Page:**
```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/diagnostics
```

Both pages will show:
- ‚úÖ Environment variable status
- üñºÔ∏è Live image loading tests  
- üîç Console debugging info

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Open your deployed site
2. Press **F12** (Developer Tools)
3. Check **Console** tab for messages like:
   - `üö® Cloudinary Debug: VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is not set`
   - `‚úÖ Using fallback image for: dsecure/logos/logo`

### Step 4: Verify Image URLs Directly
Test these URLs directly in your browser:
- https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo
- https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo-white

If these work, the issue is environment variables.

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Detected
**Symptoms:** Browser console shows "VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is not set"  
**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify exact spelling: `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
2. ‚úÖ Ensure it's set for **Production** environment
3. ‚úÖ **Redeploy** after setting (critical step!)
4. ‚úÖ Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue 2: Images Load Locally But Not on Vercel
**Symptoms:** Works in development, fails in production  
**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check if you're testing the wrong environment (Preview vs Production)
2. ‚úÖ Ensure the variable is set for the correct environment
3. ‚úÖ Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment for cache clearing

### Issue 3: Fallback Images Show Instead of Cloudinary
**Symptoms:** Local logo.svg shows instead of Cloudinary images  
**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ This is actually correct behavior when environment variable is missing
2. ‚úÖ Check console for debugging messages
3. ‚úÖ Visit `/debug.html` to confirm environment status

### Issue 4: Mixed Results (Some Images Work, Others Don't)
**Symptoms:** Header logo works but footer doesn't (or vice versa)  
**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Clear browser cache completely
2. ‚úÖ Check all publicId paths are correct
3. ‚úÖ Verify all CloudinaryLogo components have fallback props

### Verification Steps:
- [ ] Visit your site: `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
- [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12)
- [ ] Check Console for Cloudinary debug messages
- [ ] Visit `/debug.html` for environment status
- [ ] Visit `/diagnostics` for comprehensive testing

## üöÄ Build Commands Used

The following commands verify everything works:

```bash
# Test Cloudinary configuration
npm run test-cloudinary

# Verify assets are uploaded  
npm run verify-assets

# Build and deploy
npm run build
```

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If images still don't load after following all steps:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after redeployment for CDN cache to clear
2. **Test in incognito/private browser window** to avoid cache issues
3. **Check the exact error messages** in browser console
4. **Try the debug URLs** to see exactly what's happening
5. **Verify you're testing the right deployment** (not a preview)

## üìû Expected Behavior

**‚úÖ When Working Correctly:**
- Console shows no Cloudinary errors
- Images load from `res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/...` URLs
- `/debug.html` shows environment variable is set
- `/diagnostics` shows images loading successfully

**‚ùå When Environment Variable Missing:**
- Console shows: "VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is not set"
- Local fallback images (logo.svg, blogo.svg) are used
- `/debug.html` shows variable is missing
- `/diagnostics` shows environment variable status

The debugging tools will clearly indicate what's happening!
