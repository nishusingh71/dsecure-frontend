# Features Display Update

## Overview
Updated CheckoutPage and OrderSuccessPage to show only "Included" features for selected plans, removing any "Not Included" mentions for better user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. CheckoutPage.tsx
- **Modified Features Section**: Updated the features display to:
  - Filter features to show only those starting with "INCLUDED:"
  - Remove the "INCLUDED: " prefix for cleaner display
  - Maintain the green checkmark icons for all included features

### 2. OrderSuccessPage.tsx
- **Added Features Interface**: Extended OrderData interface to include `features?: string[]`
- **Added Features Section**: New section showing included features with:
  - Consistent styling with CheckoutPage
  - Same filtering logic (show only "INCLUDED:" features)
  - Clean feature names without prefixes
  - Green checkmark icons for visual consistency

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **PricingAndPlanPage** → Features array contains both "INCLUDED:" and "NOT INCLUDED:" items
2. **CheckoutPage** → Filters and displays only "INCLUDED:" features  
3. **OrderSuccessPage** → Receives features via localStorage and displays same filtered list

### Filtering Logic
```javascript
features
  .filter((feature) => feature.startsWith("INCLUDED:"))
  .map((feature) => feature.replace("INCLUDED: ", ""))
```

- ✅ Only shows features that are actually included in the plan
- ✅ Eliminates confusion from "NOT INCLUDED" items  
- ✅ Cleaner, more positive presentation
- ✅ Consistent styling across checkout and success pages
- ✅ Better focus on value proposition

## Verification
