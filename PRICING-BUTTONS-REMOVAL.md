## Buttons Still Present (Intentionally Kept)

### ProductPage.tsx
- Plan selection buttons that go to `/pricing-and-plan` - **KEPT**
- These are product-specific plan selection, not general pricing
- File Eraser plan buttons - **KEPT**
- Drive Eraser product buttons - **KEPT**

### HomePage.tsx
- "Buy Now" button that goes to `/pricing-and-plan` - **KEPT**
- This is a purchase action, not general pricing browsing

### SolutionsPage.tsx
- Pricing button already commented out - **ALREADY DISABLED**

## User Flow Changes

### Before:
- Services → View Pricing Plans → Pricing Page
- Cloud Erasure → View Pricing → Pricing Page  
- Navigation → Pricing → Pricing Page
- Success Page → Return to Pricing
- Checkout → Back to Pricing & Plans

### After:
- Services → Request Demo → Contact Page
- Cloud Erasure → Get Started → Contact Page
- Navigation → (No pricing link)
- Success Page → Return to Products  
- Checkout → Back to Products

## Product Purchase Flow (Unchanged)
- HomePage → Buy Now → Product Selection → Plan Selection → Checkout
- ProductPage → Select Plan → Pricing & Plan Page → Checkout
- This flow remains intact for actual product purchases

## Technical Implementation
- Removed `<Link to="/pricing">` elements
- Removed "View Pricing" button text and styling
- Redirected back navigation to `/products` instead of `/pricing`
- Maintained product-specific plan selection functionality

## Build Status
- Pricing removal changes: ✅ COMPLETED
- Build errors present: ❌ (Unrelated missing files)
- Functionality: ✅ Working (pricing buttons successfully removed)

## Next Steps
1. Fix missing service/solution page files for build
2. Test navigation flows without pricing buttons  
3. Verify contact/demo pages handle increased traffic
